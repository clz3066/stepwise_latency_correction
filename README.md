# stepwise_latency_correction

## Introduction
This repository hosts the code for two papers:
- **group_level**: Li, Y., Sommer, W., Tian, L. et al. Assessing the influence of latency variability on EEG classifiers - a case study of face repetition priming. Cognitive Neurodynamics 18, 4055â€“4069 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11571-024-10181-2   
- **individual_level**: Relationship between classifier-quantified priming effects in ERPs and face cognition ability: Contributions of task difficulty and latency variability  

TODO: Some codes in this repository are redundant and not relevant to the paper.
